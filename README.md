- I go by ErrantWitch these days.
- I'm primarily interested in learning anything related to code. I've started with minor json entry editing, currently learning PowerShell.
- There is a certain program I wish to work on, but I haven't the skills. Let me learn PowerScript first. It's a bit like learning English.
- I know Python is the Esperanto of coding, but I've already started on this path. Let me at least see it through,
- And not embarass myself in front of my relative.
